# Gyroscopic-Watch-Winder
When my first mechanical watch was passed down to me, I decided I wanted a watch winder to keep it running optimally. I thought gyroscopic winders looked fascinating, and I also discovered that they are better for the watch. I designed one to be made using my home 3D printer.

## Mechanical Design

The mechanical assembly was designed entirely in SolidWorks. The components were designed with 3D printing in mind, hence they use minimal support material, and the moving parts were all printed in place. Instead of bearings, as used in a traditional design, I opted to use print-in-place pin joints which I then lubricated. The joints are quite, durable, and low friction.

## Electrical Design


The electrical components, include a stepper motor, an on/off button, and a bluetooth module. They are programmed via an Arduino Nano. The winding settings are programmable via an accompanying iOS app.
