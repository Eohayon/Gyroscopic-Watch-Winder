# Gyroscopic-Watch-Winder
When my first mechanical watch was passed down to me, I decided I wanted a watch winder to keep it running optimally. I thought gyroscopic winders looked fascinating, and I also discovered that they are better for the watch. I designed one to be made using my home 3D printer.
